          <h2>Pokémon Orange &amp; Blue</h2>
          <p>Pokémon Orange &amp; Blue is a version of the Pokémon games themed around Bucknell University. It is written in Java and was created by myself and 3 others in the spring of 2016 for a Software Engineering and Design class.
            <p>Our goal was to create something that looked and felt like one of the original Pokémon games. I was in charge of creating the graphical interface and its interactions with the underlying components of the game.</p>

          <h2>Dime</h2>
          <p>Dime is an iOS application designed to simplify sending expense reports. Its main goal is to make expense reports easy by not requiring a third-party web account to compile or send a group of expenses as a report.</p>
          <p>Dime compiles recorded expenses into PDFs, generating them on the device itself, meaning no internet is required to push a report to the user's outbox.</p>

          <h2>Physio</h2>
          <p>Physio is an android application that acts as means of communication between a Microsoft Band and a remote server used to gather a user's physiological signals. The gathered physiological data can then be fed to a cognitive architecture that uses machine learning techniques to create a cognitive model personalized to the user. </p>
          <p> The application itself is written in Java and uses HTTP POST requests authenticated with Java Web Tokens to communicate with the companion server, written in Node.js with a MongoDB database.</p>

          <p>In the summer of 2016, I spent 3 months as a student research assistant working with Professor Chris Dancy. The goal of my research was designing and implementing an architecture for communication between a Microsoft Band smart watch and a Lisp based cognitive architecture (ACT-R/Φ). I did this by creating an Android application (Physio) that would pass data using JWT-secured HTTP POST requests from the watch to a Node.js server running on my computer.

          <p>My classes at Bucknell have not only helped me to learn and improve my coding, but have also taught me how to work as a member of a team using design frameworks like scrum to create software. Bucknell also led me to Android development when I did research in the computer science department in the summer of 2016.
